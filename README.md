InstaBasic is an API wrapper for [Instagram's Basic Display API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/). I was in the process of writing python code using the Basic Display API, and I created this package for others to use. My goal for this is to support every official Basic Display API [endpoint](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/reference).

*This package does not support the [Instagram Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/)*

## Installation
`pip install instabasic`

## Overview
The Instagram Basic Display API is an HTTP-based API for apps to get an Instagram userâ€™s profile, images, videos, and albums. To use InstaBasic you will need to do the following:
 - Create a Facebook Developer Account
 - Create a public website
 - Provide Instagram users with an Auth link for access to their data.

Instagram's documentation includes a thorough [overview](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/overview) of the API's capabilities. If you are unfamiliar with the Basic Display API, I recommend first reviewing their [Get Started Guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/getting-started) before looking at InstaBasic's documentation.
