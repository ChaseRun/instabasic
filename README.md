InstaBasic is an API wrapper for [Instagram's Basic Display API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/). I was in the process of writing python code using the Basic Display API, and I created this package for others to use. My goal for this is to support every official Basic Display API [endpoint](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/reference).

*This package does not support the [Instagram Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/)*

## Installation
`pip install instabasic`

## Overview
The Instagram Basic Display API is an HTTP-based API that apps can use to get an Instagram userâ€™s profile, images, videos, and albums. To InstaBasic you will need to do the following:
 - Create a Facebook Developer Account
 - Create a public websice with HTTPS
 - Provide Instagram users with an Auth link so they can grant you data access permissions.

Instagram's documentation includes a thorough [overview](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/overview) of the API's limitations. I recommend first reviewing their [Get Started Guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/getting-started), it takes around 5-10 minutes to complete. Afterwords, check out InstaBasic's documentation, and you should be good to go!
